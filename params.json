The use of formal methods for software is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a design.\r\nI'm using formal methods verify industry critical algorithms [(Link)](https://github.com/narrowfail/formal).\r\n\r\n\r\n### My services\r\n\r\nI'm offering my services through [pyspring](http://www.pyspring.com).
